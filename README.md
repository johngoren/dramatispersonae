# Dramatis Personae: Identify first mentions of people in articles

Experiments in the NLP technique of NER (named entity recognition), used on journalism pieces. 

Ever been halfway down a long feature article, seen a last name--"Smith leans back in his chair", and asked yourself, having forgotten who that is, "Wait, who is Smith again?" and had to scroll back up to Smith's first mention? This will be a browser plugin to solve that problem. It will build lists of first identifications of people in stories, and then let you refer to them while reading.

Testing this on the classic 1980 Jimmy Breslin piece, "Are You John Lennon?" from the New York Daily News, the 1965 Gay Talese piece "Frank Sinatra Has A Cold," from Esquire (the one where Frank goes into a pool room and gets into a fight with Harlan Ellison), and Joan Didion's 1961 "On Self-Respect."

You will be able to click on a name in a story and then see a cast of characters from the piece.
