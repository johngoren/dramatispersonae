Experiments in the ML technique of NEP (named entity recognition), used on journalism pieces. 

Ever been halfway down a long feature article, seen a last name--"Smith leans back in his chair", and asked yourself, "Who is Smith again?" and had to scroll back up to Smith's first mention?

Testing this on the classic 1980 Jimmy Breslin piece, "Are You John Lennon?" from the New York Daily News and the 1965 Gay Talese piece "Frank Sinatra Has A Cold," from Esquire (the one where Frank goes into a pool room and gets into a fight with Harlan Ellison)
